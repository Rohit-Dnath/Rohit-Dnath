Hey 👋 I’m Rohit.

Computer Science (AI/ML) undergrad focused on backend engineering and scalable SaaS systems.  
Currently interning at **Intervue.io**, working across backend, product, and research.

I work primarily with Node.js and TypeScript, designing APIs, data models, and backend systems that scale, stay maintainable, and fail gracefully.  
I enjoy owning problems end-to-end and building things from scratch in fast-moving environments.

This profile contains backend-heavy projects, experiments, and tools I actively maintain.
